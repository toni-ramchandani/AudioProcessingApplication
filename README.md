# AudioProcessingApplication
Powered by Python, Streamlit, and the Gemini 1.5 model, this app is a game-changer in audio analysis.

# AI-Powered Audio Processing App
Welcome to the repository for the AI-Powered Audio Processing App. This application, built with Streamlit and Google's Generative AI, is designed to allow users to upload audio files and receive AI-generated text outputs based on custom prompts. The application can handle various tasks such as audio summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Features
Upload audio files in WAV or MP3 format.
Provide a custom prompt to guide the AI on processing the audio file.
Play the uploaded audio within the application.
View AI-generated text outputs based on the provided prompts.
How It Works
Upon uploading an audio file and entering a custom AI prompt, the process_audio function activates and uses Google's Generative AI to process the audio. The audio is first saved to a temporary location on the server, and then the generative model interprets the audio content, producing a relevant text output.

## Customization
Users can customize the application through the Streamlit interface. The user interface (UI) is designed with injected custom CSS for a better visual experience, with enhanced buttons and input fields.
